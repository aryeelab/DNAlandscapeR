Description: A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization
    system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on
    multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics
    needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard
    requirements. See ?Lattice for an introduction.
